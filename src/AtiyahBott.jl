"""
**AtiyahBott** is a module containing an implementation of the Atiyah-Bott residue 
formula in the Julia language. The theory behind the package is described in the paper 
"Effective computations of the Atiyah-Bott formula" by Giosu√® Muratore and 
Csaba Schneider (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11183.pdf).
The degree of the curves of the moduli space must be at most 13.
The projective space must be at most of dimension 254.
The colorations (useful to speed up the code) are up to projective spaces of dimension 29.
The full list is here: https://github.com/mgemath/Colorations/.
